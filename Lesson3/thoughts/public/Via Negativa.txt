Via Negativa

Via Negativa, a term used by Nassim Nicholas Taleb. What we donï¿½t do, what 
we remove, can be more influential than what we do. Not smoking is one of 
the best things you can do for your health. Removing your phone from the 
same room as you, may be your greatest productivity strategies for deep 
work. Certainly for a more personal dinner with a friend. 
Remove frailties before you build robustness. If the instability of your legs 
puts you at risk of falling, don't work on your biceps. 

Remove friction that delays work occurring. Make things easier for you to do 
the work you already know you have to do. Save your energy for the task by 
making it easier to get started.

In Cal Newport's Deep Work, page 76, he writes of the research of Winifred 
Gallagher and that "what we choose to focus on and what we choose to 
ignore" is incredibly powerful in shaping our brains and experience and 
worldview. This is very in line with stoic philosophy and the idea that the 
only choice and power that we have is really around our outlook. We might 
not really have control of our thoughts, as things arise and fall away, and 
yet if we pay attention than we can let go of thoughts, allowing our attention 
the space it needs. So it feels logical that we could choose to make certain 
things more important and focus on those. 80/20 what to focus on.
