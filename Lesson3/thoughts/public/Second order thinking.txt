Second order thinking

When thinking of eliminating something, physical, structural, whatever, be 
sure to first understand the thinking behind why it was put in place. 
Assuming that many people are lazy at heart (not in a bad way, in the sense 
that we are not eager to do hard work without good reason), it is unlikely 
that someone went through the trouble of planning, designing and installing 
a fence for no reason. What were they aiming to accomplish with the fence 
in the first place? Understand that before you decide if it should be 
removed. 

This feels like an important component of via negativa. Conversely, some or 
maybe a lot of structures and norms are actually born out of this laziness of 
people. We take the low friction path. Newport argues in A World Without 
Email that low friction is one of the main reasons that email is so prevalent; 
it is easy to do. You can't just "get rid of email". First you have to understand 
what every email is trying to accomplish; 1) exercising agency and 
communicating an individuals voice, 2) to schedule something, 3) trying to 
capture and articulate an idea, 3) creating a record of decisions, the CYA 
email. What could the best way to accomplish this goal be? In the case of 
email, it turns out that email is total shit for accomplishing these things. 
Back and forth emails to schedule gets confusing between a bunch of people. 
Email as a record also makes no sense as it is basically private. If I built a 
system for scheduling, for capturing the decision process and someone came 
through and said "We're getting rid of that. Just send an email". They would 
have failed to consider why the system was in place.

After reading Four Fish by Paul Greenberg I need to consider my gut 
reaction against fish farming (and admit that I really know much about it). 
Why does fish farming exist? Certainly, there are big companies trying to 
make money, and certainly many of those companies are fucking over the 
small farmers, in the sea and on land. But some of the scientists who 
studied livestock efficiency (increase the grain/lb of meat) did so out of an 
earnest and noble quest to eliminate hunger. Fish farming exists to produce 
salmon meat in a quantity, at a price, that people can feed themselves. And 
why not wild caught? Those populations are collapsing. Why? Because of a 
history of dammed rivers and high tech sea fishing. Could the wild runs of 
fish have fed us all? We tend not to like such seasonality. 

I canï¿½t claim to just get rid of industrial agriculture and livestock farming 
without acknowledging all the complicated histories, natural and otherwise, 
that go into the events that have led to our current system. There is a lot of 
really good intent that has gone into the advances that have led to our 
current system. And a lot of ignorance, poor thinking, misinformation, greed, 
dodging responsibility, and capitalist fervor as well.
